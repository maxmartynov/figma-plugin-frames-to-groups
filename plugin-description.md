This is a plugin that provides an easy way to convert Frames to Groups.

# How To Use

Select layers and run the command 'Convert Frames to Groups' and all Frames inside the selected layers will be converted to Groups.

# Cases

- If no layers are selected, then all frames on the page will be converted.
- If a component with the type 'Instance' is selected, nothing will be changed inside it. To convert Frames inside an Instance component you should select the source component of this Instance.
- See plugin's Settings for more.
