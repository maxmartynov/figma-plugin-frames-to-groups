This is a plugin that provides an easy way to convert Frames to Groups.

How To Use:
Select layers and run the command 'Convert Frames to Groups' and all
Frames inside the selected layers will be converted to Groups.

Cases:
- If no layers are selected, then all frames on the page will be converted.
- If you select a Frame, only the inner Frames will be converted,
not the selected one.
- If a component with the type 'Instance' is selected, nothing will be changed inside it. To convert Frames inside an Instance component
you should select the source component of this Instance.
